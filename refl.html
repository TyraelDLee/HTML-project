        <p>For built this web, I in this course I had learned many thing as well, include HTML and CSS and how to use them. Also I had learned a lot of design style from developed well-design web like Apple.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, following my web developing, I find HTML and CSS is easier than I learned at beginning. For now, I could able to find what mistake I had made and fix them quickly. Specially for CSS, at beginning, I was difficult to locate elements position whit my design, like I want put something on the right of web, but them always stay at left. However, that is easy for me now.</p>
        <p>Also, I had learned how to make animation by using CSS only, but before that, I was think that the JavaScript is the only way to implement animation effects. By using HTML5, I also learned about how to make an online player by using HTML only.</p>
        <p>This web is talking about the CPUs, I used lots of knowledge about CPU which I know. However, following developing the material in this web, I also learn more about CPUs which I didnâ€™t know before.</p>
